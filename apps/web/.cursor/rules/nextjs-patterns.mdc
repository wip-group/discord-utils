# Next.js App Router Patterns

## File Structure
- Use App Router structure in `src/app/`
- Group routes with parentheses: `(auth)`, `(main)`, `(legal)`
- Place middleware at `src/middleware.ts`
- Components in `src/components/` with subfolders for organization

## Environment Variables
- Validate environment variables in `src/env.ts` using @t3-oss/env-core
- Client-side vars must have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- Import validated env as `import { env } from "@/env"`

## Component Patterns
- Use `"use client"` directive for client components
- Prefer server components by default
- Import UI components from `@repo/ui/components/*` or `@/components/ui`
- Use Tailwind classes with automatic sorting via Biome

## tRPC Integration
- Configure tRPC client in `src/utils/trpc.ts`
- Use tRPC React Query hooks for data fetching
- Wrap app with tRPC provider in layout or providers component

## Auth Integration
- Use Better Auth React client from `src/lib/auth-client.ts`
- Check auth state with Better Auth hooks
- Protected routes handled by middleware, not component-level checks
